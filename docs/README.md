# noFace

This app uses Web RTC to stream a desktop inside of a docker container, original author made this because [rabb.it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabb.it) went under and his internet could not handle streaming and discord kept crashing when his friend attempted to. He just wanted to watch anime with his friends ლ(ಠ益ಠლ) so he started digging throughout the internet and found a few *kinda* clones, but none of them had the virtual browser, then he found [Turtus](https://github.com/Khauri/Turtus) and he was able to figure out the rest.

Then I found [this](https://github.com/nurdism/neko) project and started to dig into it. I really liked the idea of having collaborative browser browsing together with mutliple people, so I created a fork. Initially, I wanted to merge my changes to the upstream repository, but the original author did not have time for this project anymore and it got eventually archived.

### Features

  * Text Chat (With basic markdown support, discord flavor)
  * Admin users (Kick, Ban & Force Give/Release Controls)
  * Clipboard synchronization (on [supported browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard/readText))
  * Emote overlay
  * Ignore user (chat and emotes)
  * Persistent settings

### Why noFace?

I'm a weeb/nerd, anime is cool.

***Why the creepy face?*** 

Because it's a character from *Spirted Away* called *no face*, the movie was created by Studio Ghibi, one of the best (I think) anime filmmakers of this century.
